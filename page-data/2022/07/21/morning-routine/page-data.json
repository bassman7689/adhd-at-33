Keeping track of\nthe things that I do to make life easier. Things that I figure out to help\nmyself or my daughter deal better with life and ADHD. So I guess this is as\ngood a time as any to start. Before I get to far in this thing, let me tell\nyou something important: I am not an ADHD expert, I don't even play one on TV.\nI am not an ADHD coach, a therapist, a neurologist, or a psychologist. I am\njust a software engineer with a 6 year old daughter. But, I have been really\nworking to find things that can help us. Some of these things are the really\nobvious stuff. Writing things down, or exercise, medication for me and hopefully\nfor my daughter as soon as we have finished her diagnostic process (she hasn't\nbeen officially diagnosed yet, but her doctor indicated that she strongly suspects\nthat she does have it), things like that. But, there are other things that you might\nnot think about.</p>\n<p>For instance, did you know that if you get everything that you need to cook\nbreakfast together the night before, it makes getting ready fairly quickly in\nthe morning A LOT easier?! I didn't know that, until I started cooking an egg white\nomlete with red, green, yellow, and orange bell peppers, and yellow and red\nonions every morning. Sounds like a lot of work, huh? Well, it isn't. The only\nthing I have to do every morning is just mix the egg whites, bell peppers, onions,\nand some cilantro, salt, and pepper in a bowl and put it in the non-stick skillet\nfor about 5 minutes. Then I grate some pepper jack cheese on top of ite(I used\nto get the pre-grated cheese, but I tried grating it myself and was suprised to\nlearn it actually tastes even better when you do that!), fold it and I am most\nof the way done with my breakfast in less than 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>I also have to take a backpack to work every day with my work computer,\nmy keyboard (I like using expensive, mechnical keyboards for work), headphones,\nDAC, and my usb dongle for more plugs (I use a mac for work, love the unix based\nworld, but hate the limited number of ports lol). So I put my backpack in front\nof the front door, where I would have to trip over it and move it out of the way\nto get out the front door without it. This way, even if I forget it exists, I will\nstill probably take it with me in the morning. I have an almost 1 hour long commute\nto work every day, so I don't want to get all the way there and realize that I\nforgot that stuff. That would not be fun.</p>\n<p>When it comes to my daughter, right now she goes to a summer day camp. Every day\nshe needs to have 2 full outfits, a bathing suit, a towel, sunscreen, 2 snacks,\na lunch, and a full water bottle. If you think about it though, none of that\nstuff has to be gotten together right before we leave. So, I get all of the clothes\nand stuff together the night before and put them in her backpack. Then I get her\nsnacks, lunch, and water bottle ready to go and put them in the fridge. So in\nthe morning, we just have to grab that stuff and walk out the door. Having all\nof these things prepared and ready when I wake up in the morning makes me a lot\nless stressed. I feel a lot less rushed to get everything done in the morning,\nbecause I get most of it done before I even go to bed the night before.</p>\n<p>Those are just a few of the simple things I do every day to make life easier. there\nare other things too, but those are for future posts. Let me know what you think,\nand if you have things that you do differently, or more ideas for making life just\na little easier, let me know!
