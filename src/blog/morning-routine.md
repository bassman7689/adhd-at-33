  I have been thinking a lot about writing all of this down. Keeping track of
  the things that I do to make life easier. Things that I figure out to help
  myself or my daughter deal better with life and ADHD. So I guess this is as
  good a time as any to start. Before I get to far in this thing, let me tell
  you something important: I am not an ADHD expert, I don't even play one on TV.
  I am not an ADHD coach, a therapist, a neurologist, or a psychologist. I am
  just a software engineer with a 6 year old daughter. But, I have been really
  working to find things that can help us. Some of these things are the really
  obvious stuff. Writing things down, or exercise, medication for me and hopefully
  for my daughter as soon as we have finished her diagnostic process (she hasn't
  been officially diagnosed yet, but her doctor indicated that she strongly suspects
  that she does have it), things like that. But, there are other things that you might
  not think about.

  For instance, did you know that if you get everything that you need to cook
  breakfast together the night before, it makes getting ready fairly quickly in
  the morning A LOT easier?! I didn't know that, until I started cooking an egg white
  omlete with red, green, yellow, and orange bell peppers, and yellow and red
  onions every morning. Sounds like a lot of work, huh? Well, it isn't. The only
  thing I have to do every morning is just mix the egg whites, bell peppers, onions,
  and some cilantro, salt, and pepper in a bowl and put it in the non-stick skillet
  for about 5 minutes. Then I grate some pepper jack cheese on top of ite(I used
  to get the pre-grated cheese, but I tried grating it myself and was suprised to
  learn it actually tastes even better when you do that!), fold it and I am most
  of the way done with my breakfast in less than 10 minutes.

  I also have to take a backpack to work every day with my work computer,
  my keyboard (I like using expensive, mechnical keyboards for work), headphones,
  DAC, and my usb dongle for more plugs (I use a mac for work, love the unix based
  world, but hate the limited number of ports lol). So I put my backpack in front
  of the front door, where I would have to trip over it and move it out of the way
  to get out the front door without it. This way, even if I forget it exists, I will
  still probably take it with me in the morning. I have an almost 1 hour long commute
  to work every day, so I don't want to get all the way there and realize that I
  forgot that stuff. That would not be fun.

  When it comes to my daughter, right now she goes to a summer day camp. Every day
  she needs to have 2 full outfits, a bathing suit, a towel, sunscreen, 2 snacks,
  a lunch, and a full water bottle. If you think about it though, none of that
  stuff has to be gotten together right before we leave. So, I get all of the clothes
  and stuff together the night before and put them in her backpack. Then I get her
  snacks, lunch, and water bottle ready to go and put them in the fridge. So in
  the morning, we just have to grab that stuff and walk out the door. Having all
  of these things prepared and ready when I wake up in the morning makes me a lot
  less stressed. I feel a lot less rushed to get everything done in the morning,
  because I get most of it done before I even go to bed the night before.

  Those are just a few of the simple things I do every day to make life easier. there
  are other things too, but those are for future posts. Let me know what you think,
  and if you have things that you do differently, or more ideas for making life just
  a little easier, let me know! You can find my contact information on the about page.
