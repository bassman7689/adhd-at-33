  I was diagnosed with ADHD at 8 years old. However, the only thing that I really learned
  from that was that I had it and I needed to take some medication. I took Ritalin at first,
  eventually moving to Adderall XR. When I was 13 I was asked if I thought I needed to take
  the medication anymore. I said that I thought I didn't. A year later I was already in a
  different psychologist's office learning that I had depression. That was also the first
  time I stayed in a mental ward. By the time I was 19, I was learning that I also have
  generalized anxiety. That was the second time I stayed in a mental ward. During this
  whole time, I didn't even remember I had ADHD. As my life progressed, I always wondered
  why life was so hard. Never knowing how ADHD was effecting every aspect of my life.
  Then, on January 15th 2021, I went to the doctor because I was having trouble with my 
  sleep. I found out that day that I had diabetes, I was 442 lbs, and I setup a time
  for a sleep study. I found out through that sleep study that I have Obstructive Sleep
  Apnea. That started the most transformative year of my life. I started loosing weight,
  I found out that I didn't outgrow my ADHD, I learned what it really is, what it causes,
  some strategies to help me deal with it. I learned to not be so hard on myself. Now,
  a little over a year and a half later, I have lost 220 lbs, and I feel happier than
  I have in my life. That is the start of my personal journey with ADHD, and how I got
  back to it. Also, during this time I was able to help my brother find out that he
  has ADHD as well. I am pretty sure my sister and mother have ADHD as well. I have
  talked with both my mother and sister about the need to get diagnosed. They are both
  in the process of getting evaluated. Also, I am currently in the process of getting
  my daughter evaluated.
